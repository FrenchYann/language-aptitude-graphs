An editor to create a radial graph chart for language aptitude.
For now it has two tabs:

- Reading:
  - Pronounciation
  - Delivery
  - Content
  - Comprehension
  - Phrasing
  - Grammar
- Writing:
  - Convention
  - Hand Writing
  - Content
  - Comprehension
  - Phrasing
  - Grammar

But in reality, you can use it for other things by directly doing something like:

Have fun.
